# ItemFind
This plugin will be used to search for items within the runelite client. Pulling info from the wiki page

# Add pictures for clicking/typing.
# Would be cool to include a section for autofill for item searching
# NEED TO ADD UNTRADABLES
# Current logic prevents this because there is a built in 'tradable' item list I parse through
